Problem: Access child component from parent component without re-rendering and passing props or state.

Solution: Ref forwarding is a technique for automatically passing a ref through a component to one of its children. This is typically not necessary for most components in the application. However, it can be useful for some kinds of components, especially in reusable component libraries.
